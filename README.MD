# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Python Portfolio Project** 🐉 that involves working with Python
libraries & modules such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **SciPy** 
and **Statsmodels**. The dataset I am working on is a CSV file with apartment🏚️ rental information.


The project includes such steps as importing all the necessary libraries & modules, creating a 
**Pandas DataFrame** from a CSV file📅, **Cleaning & Transforming** the DataFrame, applying **Descriptive
Statistics** and checking the **Normal Distribution** of apartment prices, analyzing the **Correlation**
and predicting apartment price based on its size using **Regression Analysis**📈!
