# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Python Portfolio Project** üêâ that involves working with Python
libraries & modules such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **SciPy** 
and **Statsmodels**. The dataset I am working on is a CSV file with apartmentüèöÔ∏è rental information.


The project includes such steps as importing all the necessary libraries & modules, creating a 
**Pandas DataFrame** from a CSV file, **Cleaning & Transforming** the DataFrame, applying **Descriptive Statistics**
and checking the **Normal Distribution** of apartment prices, analyzing the **Correlation** and predicting 
apartment price based on its size using **Regression Analysis**!
